# Fermat

A small program where we utilized Fermat's Little Theorem and Miller-Rabin in order to determine whether or not a given value is prime.

Fermat has a higher chance to fail and will fail with a low enough k-value (where k is the number of tests done). 
Miller-Rabin is mroe likely to catch any numbers that fall through the cracks, like carmichael numbers (i.e. 561)
